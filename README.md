## Concepts learned

This was my first Javascript project. I was given starting html and an event listener, but wrote out the rest
of the logic myself. There were a lot of "rabbit holes" I jumped down be able to complete this concept. Some of the
major areas I learned more about was:

- a deeper understanding of scope
- using objects when i need to pass along multiple values to future functions
- naming variables clearly for my fuature self and other programmers
